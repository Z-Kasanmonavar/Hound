### What Hound have :
* Destroy the file.s content, by overwriting it with random datas
* Choose the number of iterations, to increase the safety!
* Comfy Terminal use!

### Install Hound :
```
wget 'https://github.com/tomwongs/hound/releases/download/v2.1.0/hound.deb'
```
```
sudo apt install ./hound.deb
```

### Or you can copy and paste this command, for a clean installation :  

```
wget 'https://github.com/tomwongs/hound/releases/download/v2.1.0/hound.deb' hound.deb; sudo apt install ./hound.deb; rm --force ./hound.deb
```

### How can I use it? :

#### Common usage :   
`hound [<switches>..] <folder/file>`   

#### Switches :  
`-a (--angry) [number]` : number of iteration done (default: 1).  
`-c (--chomp)` : leave the file unreadable and unrecoverable.  
`-h (--help)` : display help.  

I hope this program will be helpful to you and that you'll use Hound on your own datas! ^^
