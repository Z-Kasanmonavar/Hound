![hound-icon](https://github.com/Z-Kasanmonavar/Hound/assets/47051741/0c73d35c-1037-4a83-b0e9-f831705d4f42)
### What Hound have :
* Destroy the file.s content, by overwriting it with random data
* Choose the number of iterations, to increase the safety!
* Comfy Terminal use!

### Install Hound :
```
wget 'https://github.com/Z-Kasanmonavar/Hound/releases/download/v1.0.0/hound.deb'
```
```
sudo apt install ./hound.deb
```

### Or you can copy and paste this command, for a clean installation :  

```
wget 'https://github.com/Z-Kasanmonavar/Hound/releases/download/v1.0.0/hound.deb' hound.deb; sudo apt install ./hound.deb; rm --force ./hound.deb
```

### How can I use it? :

#### Common usage :   
`hound [<switches>..] <folder/file>`   

#### Switches :  
`-a (--angry) [number]` : number of iteration done (default: 1).  
`-c (--chomp)` : leave the file unreadable and unrecoverable.  
`-h (--help)` : display help.  

I hope this program will be helpful to you and that you'll use Hound on your own datas! ^^

### Contributions : 
This github is more a place for me to share my programs and store them.  
I'm not ready yet to deal with a project modified by other people.  
Thanks for your understanding.

I hope you don't like this project too much, because the source code got corrupted when changing my computer ^^'  
So I won't be able to release other versions with patches or corrections...  
I'll maybe rewrite the code and the software, but more clean.  
After all, what is 400 lines of code? T w T
