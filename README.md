### What Hound have :
* Destroy the file.s content, by overwriting it with random data
* Choose the number of iterations, to increase the safety!
* Comfy Terminal use!

### Install Hound :
```
wget 'https://github.com/tomwongs/hound/releases/download/v2.0.0/hound.deb'
```
```
sudo apt install ./hound.deb
```

### Or you can copy and paste this command, for a clean installation :  

```
wget 'https://github.com/tomwongs/hound/releases/download/v2.0.0/hound.deb' hound.deb; sudo apt install ./hound.deb; rm --force ./hound.deb
```

### How can I use it? :

#### Common usage :   
`hound [<switches>..] <folder/file>`   

#### Switches :  
`-a (--angry) [number]` : number of iteration done (default: 1).  
`-c (--chomp)` : leave the file unreadable and unrecoverable.  
`-h (--help)` : display help.  

I hope this program will be helpful to you and that you'll use Hound on your own datas! ^^

### Contributions : 
This github is more a place for me to share my programs and store them.  
I'm not ready yet to deal with a project modified by other people.  
Thanks for your understanding.  

### About Hound :
After loosing the source code of Hound v1.0.0, I decided to rewrite Hound from scratch.
This unfortunate event gave me the opportunity of bettering my code, I've written it with less line, and is now less consuming!
I'm quite proud of this new Hound and I don't regret the old source-code! ^^
