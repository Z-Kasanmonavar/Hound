# ! This Linux package is made for destroying your own datas, you SHOULDN'T use it on datas that AREN'T yours !
## This package was only tested to work on Debian and Ubuntu

For the moment the package is just an executable, you have to create an alias in your '~/.bashrc' file to be able to use it anywhere.
I'll work later on making it a true package that just have to be install using the 'wget' & 'apt' command.
This is a test!
